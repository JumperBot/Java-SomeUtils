## **"Some" Utilities you can use for your `Java` projects "*freely*"!**

\***Coughs**\* *"freely"* in the sense that you still need to include the [**`license`**](./LICENSE) into your program.

Files are **`compiled`** with **`Java-8`** and above, but mostly **`Java-11`**.

# :heavy_plus_sign: **Features** :triangular_flag_on_post:
[Contributing.md](https://github.com/JumperBot/Java-SomeUtils/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md/#navigating-the-repository) has a large ***(to very large)*** section or division just for this!

**[`This repository`](https://github.com/JumperBot/Java-SomeUtils/) has common/uncommon`utilities`** you can use for your program!

You may use any class you can find as long as you include the [**`license`**](./LICENSE).

# :wrench: **How To Use** :hammer:

**Import** a **`class`** using:

```Java
    import SomeUtils.WhatYouNeed.WhatYouNeed;
```

A **`documentation`** for each class is included in it's own [**`src/`**](./src/SomeUtils) subdirectory.
